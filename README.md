## Installation
Clone the repo into your home folder, copy or symlink dotfiles as you wish

## Warning
I'm still figuring out best practices for managing dotfiles (I've yet to install `stow`) and my setup is always changing, so things might not always be constant and could cause issues unexpectedly. Just revert to previous commits on your local repo if things go awry :)
