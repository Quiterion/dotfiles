# feh key configuration.
# Comments start with a # sign, do not use them mid-line.
# Each line must be blank, a comment, or a key definition.
#
# key definition: <action name> <key1> [<key2> [<key3>]]
#
# Each <key> is an X11 keysym (as output by xev) with optional modifier.
# For instance, C-x would be Ctrl+X, or 4-space Mod4+Space

# Examples for vim-like menu bindings on a qwerty keyboard:
## menu_parent h Left
## menu_child  l Right
## menu_down   j Down
## menu_up     k Up
## menu_select space Return

# Same for image navigation ...
next_img l Right space
prev_img h Left BackSpace

# and image movement
scroll_up    K C-Up
scroll_down  J C-Down
scroll_left  H C-Left
scroll_right L C-Right

# File deletion
remove     d   Delete
delete   C-d C-Delete

# remove now conflicts with toggle_filenames, so change that
toggle_filenames f

# zooming
zoom_in k C-Up
zoom_out j C-Down
zoom_default d
zoom_fit s

save_image  C-s
## save_filelist

# This leaves some conflicts with existing default bindings, but you should
# get the idea.  And I'm not gonna fix the conflicts, I don't use qwerty ;-)
